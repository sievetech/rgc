Rackspace Garbage Collector:

A library and a tool for removing Rackspace Files in an more efficient manner.

1) About
---
Rackspace Garbage Collector is a python library and a tool that helps the user to remove unused / useless files stored in Rackspace.

To use as a command line program, just run
```shell
user=johndoe key=12345abcd rgc --rule1 param1 --rule2 param2
```
where the rules are checks applied to each file to determine if it should be deleted or not. For example, `--days 30` will remove all files older than 30 days. If more than one rule is given, they are AND'd together, i.e. a file will be removed if, and only if, it meets all conditions.
